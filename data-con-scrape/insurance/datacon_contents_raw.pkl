His applied research covers several areas of statistical analysis: econometric modeling, analysis of unevenly spaced and highly correlated multivariate time series, feature extraction and selection, sensitivity and marginal dependence analysis.

Data scientists are often interested in identifying only a few dozens of the most relevant features in order to generate actionable analyzes. Since the density distributions of the features and their interactions are usually very complex, aggregating the results from several sophisticated feature selection techniques often yields more robust results. In this presentation, we will show how R can be used in practice to select features on a large scale, based on various feature selection techniques - traditional statistical tests (R packages "stats" and "fBasics"), information theory (infotheo, mpmi) and Machine Learning (e1071, class, randomForest, gbm) - coupled with parallel code (foreach, doParallel) and distributed computing (Rmpi). Elementary theoretical aspects will be illustrated on a complex real dataset related to the predictive maintenance of jet engines, covering data visualization, R codes, algorithmic complexities and computational issues.\u000a       </td>\u000a       <td class="column-4">\u000a        Data Science &amp; Engineering\u000a        <br/>\u000a        SAT PM\u000a       </td>\u000a      </tr>\u000a     </tbody>\u000a    </table>\u000a    <!-- #tablepress-22 from cache -->\u000a   </div>\u000a   <!-- entry-content clearfix-->\u000a  </article>\u000a </section>\u000a</div>\u000a

To enable actionable results these datasets must be linked to chemical structure, target information &amp; structure and even textual data (academic literature, patents). A key output of such an activity is the ability to predict whether a molecule will exert a biological effect and ideally, how it exerts such an effect. Supporting this requires the development of infrastructure &amp; pipelines for the storage, search, visualization and analysis of these heterogeneous data types.\u000a        <br/>\u000a        <br/>\u000a        In this talk I will discuss how R plays a wide ranging role in the analysis of small molecule HTS data - ranging from database access to predictive modeling. I'll start of with a high level overview of the data types &amp; challenges that are faced at each step of the pipeline and how R is used to address them. Given the central role of chemical structure in these problems I'll discuss R tools to query and manipulate them and show how they and related data structures are used for predictive modeling. Finally I will provide a high level overview of how a variety of general techniques (network analysis, spatial correlations etc) can be fruitfully applied to and the R packages that are used.\u000a       </td>\u000a       <td class="column-4">\u000a        Big Data &amp; R\u000a        <br/>\u000a        SAT PM\u000a       </td>\u000a      </tr>\u000a     </tbody>\u000a    </table>\u000a    <!-- #tablepress-36 from cache -->\u000a   </div>\u000a   <!-- entry-content clearfix-->\u000a  </article>\u000a </section>\u000a</div>\u000a

Prior to her switch to data science, she studied social neuroscience at the University of Chicago, building machine learning models of imaging data to explain how the brains of incarcerated psychopaths perceive and process emotions. Her least favorite part of data science is pruning the scope of a project down to a manageable size. Actually, that is her least favorite part of most things.
